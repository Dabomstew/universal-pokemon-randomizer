Unit Tests
**Fix Weepinbell -> Snorlax
**Gen 1 mark BIG if BST is over 490
**Move all html rendering into freemarker
**Table of Contents quick-click for log
XX BAD IDEA XX Divide Static Pokemon into Game Corner, Overworld, and other (need to break staticPokemon list into sublists)
**Add Feebas to "Make evolutions easier / condense level evolutions" (probably just add water stone)
**Can update move with gen 5, gen 6, or both (currently missing gen 6 only)
**Black/White first gym should have types that trump chosen starter
**Misc setting for Black/White to toggle between strong against and resistant to for Cilan, Chili, Cress
**Striaton City leaders reference true types (3rd narc, block 12, index 2-4, 8-10)
XX Choice not available until game is played XXStriaton City leaders use correct starter type (3rd narc, block 12, index 7) 
**Lenora's Gym uses true type instead of normal in dialogue (3rd narc, block 23, index 1 and 2)
**Item guy in Castalia City uses the names of the true starters (3rd narc, block 30, index 3-5, 7-9, 11-13)
**Castalia City guy who praises Striaton City gym leaders should reference true type (3rd narc, block 31, index 6)
**Burgh speech should reference true type (3rd narc, block 34, index 0, 5, 11)
**Cheren's speech should reference Burgh's true type (3rd narc, block 36, index 2)
**Gym guy in Nimbasa gym should use Elesa's true type (3rd narc, block 68, index 19)
**Professor Juniper should reference Elesa's true type (3rd narc, block 95, index 2)
**Gym guy in Drifviel City should reference Clay's true type (3rd narc, block 103, index 1)
**Gym guy in Mistralton City should reference Skyla's true type (3rd narc, block 113, index 8)
**Monkey giver should use correct types (3rd narc, block 160, index 4-6)
**Black/White pinwheel Gorm should reference Lenora's and Burgh's true type (3rd narc, block 163, index 28)
**Black/White Celestial tower Skyla should reference true type (3rd narc, block 374, index 6)
**Add normalize, stall, multitype, klutz to list of banned abilities
**Monkey static has type that trumps Striaton type if randomizing trainers, or covers weakness of starter when randomizing statics
**Condense Starter evo choice to slider (random = 0, 1 or 2 = 1, 2 = 2)
Add checkbox to force starter slider to be only that value instead of greater or equal
**Randomize evolutions methods
Trainer Class Names should be gender based (Rich Boy woman not allowed) (group all trainer names and determine a 1-1 swap)
Randomize trainer held items (limit to battle tower stuff)
Type theme gyms with random trainers route trainers (keep gym trainers consistent)
Checkbox if gyms should be type randomized (regardless of route trainer randomization)
Extra Challenge Mode - All leaders have 6 pokemon
Extra E4 Challenge - Legendaries / BST of at least 600
Signature Move - All leaders have a signature move on all pokes (same as TM?)
All leader/rival pokemon are nicknamed
Type by ace (one of dual type, or if mono type, keeps mono) (keep type but change team)
RSE Gen 3 - Patch both Arco and Mach
Redo code to use PokemonSet
Explicit type starter selection (filter in/out one or more) (option for one from each)
Checkbox if rival should have super-effective starter
TM text updates for Gen 5 (use new names)
Trainer pokemon evolve at appropriate level (if at level, evolve. if not, unevolve. non-level base off bst)
Trainer random a 1-1 swap similar to global replace
Select full team instead of only starter (is it possible to prestock a pc?)
Randomize trainer held item
Shift abilities to left or right instead of randomizing (thus activating hidden abilities)
Enable patching randomization formulas
Random settings (each applicable choice is given a randomized selection. still required confirming save to allow modification)
Evolution level randomized into a range based on the resulting BST
Randomize attack effects (romHandler.saveMoves)
Move prefixes (DEFDN-Leer)
Add PokemonEmerald Party Randomizer
