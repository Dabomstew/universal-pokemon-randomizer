# Differences between this Fork and Dabomstew's Original Version
## 1.8.0
 * Converted project into Maven and brought minimum java version to 8.
 * Added an option to randomize the stats and types before or after any evolution
 randomization is applied. With this, you can get more natural evolutionary lines,
 or maintain the old method of randomization. 
 * Added an option to prevent random evolutionary lines from converging (2 pokemon
 evolve into the same thing).
 * Added an option to prevent pok√©mon from evolving into another with a lower BST.
 * Added an option to forbid lines with split evolutions from being used when
 randomizing starters.
 * Added an option for randomizing outside of any BST cap.
 * Added an option for fast text.
 * Refactored "Guaranteed Four Moves" to work on a slider of 2-4.
 * Eevee now evolves into different typed pokemon instead of sharing types (when
 evolutions are randomized).
 * Tweaked moveset randomization to better balance types in movesets.
 * Added an option to shuffle base stats between pokemon.
 * Enabled "No Broken Moves" to be used in non-random builds.
 * Refactored "Modify Levels" to work on non-random trainers.
 * Refactored "Force Fully Evolved" to work on non-random trainers.
 * Added an option to randomize starters with 1 or 2 evolutions.
 * Added an option to balance wild type frequency.
 * Added an option to have unique starter types when randomized.
 * Added an option for evolved pokemon to appear at lower levels.
 * Logs are now in HTML format and contain CSS formatting to enhance readability.

 ## 1.8.1
 * Gen 3 - Wally is now a rival which can carry a starter or team.
 * Rivals and Friends will no longer have duplicate team members.
 (the only exception is when a team is carried and a pre-evo is used)
 * Rivals and Friends can carry their team in addition to their starter.
 * Pokemon with stats above 190 or BST above 590 are now tagged as `BIG` in logs.
 * Moves with power above 95 are now tagged as `BIG` in the logs.
 * Adjusted how HP is randomized to avoid excessive skewing, leading to more stats
 in other areas (minimum of 35 instead of 20 and reduced HP growth by 10%).
 * Pokemon types can now be shuffled on a 1-for-1 basis. Does not affect moves.
 * Pokemon types can be randomized for only 1 type (2nd type is preserved).
 * Split evolutions are no longer excluded from inheriting base form types.
 * Eeveelutions are guaranteed to have different types when types are randomized.
 * Base stats can now be shuffled between pokemon. Only applies to similar power levels.
 * Base stats can also be shuffled in order and then between pokemon. Same as above.
 * Starter pokemon can now be limited based on their BST.
 * Starter pokemon can now be limited to just base forms.
 * Updated logs to show old and new trainer teams for comparison.
 * Updated trade logging to increase readability.
 * Added section to show new evolution chains through the 3rd form.
 * Added seed and settings to log (as opposed to just at the end of randomization).
