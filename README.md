The original Repo is no longer being updated, But I plan to keep improving and accepting requests to add/change/implement features as users request. Access to the original homepage is below, Soon I will be adding a url to access a compiled executable form which includes my changes and any further pull requests or updates

Remaining ReadMe below was originally created by Dabomstew
At the end of the ReadMe will be a list of changes that I have made to the program, anything not in that list was originally also created by Dabomstew

# For Program Users
If you're looking to actually *use* the randomizer as opposed to looking at the 
source code, you're reading the wrong readme file. This file shouldn't be 
included in official releases, but if it is, head on over to README.txt instead.

# Fair Warning
This GitHub repo will have live updates to the randomizer as I program them, but
it won't be at all pretty. Expect lots of spaghetti code and very little use of
best practices. Individual commits may well break randomization, so you might have
to look back in the history a little before you find something usable.

# Forks
Fork as you like, as long as you obey the terms of the included license.

# Pull Requests
If you have fixed a bug or made a cool new feature, feel free to send in a pull
request for me to review. Pull requests will be accepted/denied completely at my
own discretion and may not be responded to in a timely manner if I'm busy.

## Pull Requests that will probably be accepted:
* Well-made new features: they should obviously be free from bugs to your knowledge.
If applicable, they should be universal (major features such as randomizing a new
aspect of the games fall under this, while more minor one-off settings / misc
tweaks can be for only one game or one generation if appropriate)
* Bug fixes

## Pull Requests that will probably be denied:
* Anything that's just pure refactoring, unless you have very good reasoning
for its inclusion. Sorry, but you will need to convince me that it's necessary.
* Code that is blatantly stolen from somewhere else without appropriate credit.

# Changes made by W.Harer
added a feature that attempts to conserve evolution rules when randomizing trainer pokemon, I limited this to only fix level up/evolutionary stone evolutions but if there are others you wanted included let me know, and I'll see if I can implement it in a balanced fashion
