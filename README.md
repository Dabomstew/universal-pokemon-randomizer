Universal Pokemon Randomizer

# For Program Users
If you're looking to actually *use* the randomizer as opposed to looking at the 
source code, you're reading the wrong readme file. This file shouldn't be 
included in official releases, but if it is, head on over to README.txt instead.

# Fair Warning
This GitHub repo will have live updates to the randomizer as I program them, but
it won't be at all pretty. Expect lots of spaghetti code and very little use of
best practices. Individual commits may well break randomization, so you might have
to look back in the history a little before you find something usable.

# Forks
Fork as you like, as long as you obey the terms of the included license.

# Pull Requests
If you have fixed a bug or made a cool new feature, feel free to send in a pull
request for me to review. Pull requests will be accepted/denied completely at my
own discretion and may not be responded to in a timely manner if I'm busy.

## Pull Requests that will probably be accepted:
* Well-made new features: they should obviously be free from bugs to your knowledge.
If applicable, they should be universal (major features such as randomizing a new
aspect of the games fall under this, while more minor one-off settings / misc
tweaks can be for only one game or one generation if appropriate)
* Bug fixes

## Pull Requests that will probably be denied:
* Anything that's just pure refactoring, unless you have very good reasoning
for its inclusion. Sorry, but you will need to convince me that it's necessary.
* Code that is blatantly stolen from somewhere else without appropriate credit.
