**Notice: New binary releases of the randomizer have been indefinitely suspended since 2016. This repository remains available to distribute source code and facilitiate forks.**

# For Program Users
If you're looking to actually *use* the randomizer as opposed to looking at the 
source code, you're reading the wrong readme file. This file shouldn't be 
included in official releases, but if it is, head on over to README.txt instead.

# Purpose
The purpose of this fork is to fix minor issues, but also to rebalance/change some things. As such, you might find that some of the things that are changed are not necessarily _better,_ but rather just different. Regardless, these changes have the goal of making the randomizer more fun to play, so hopefully you (the person reading this) will agree that the changes are good.

Have a look at the [release page](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases) for changelogs.

Please note that this fork was made just because I wanted to make the races with my race crew more fun, and I don't want it to be more ambitious than that. Additions/updates will be done at my discretion, so don't contact me to tell me to add things to the randomizer. Thanks!
